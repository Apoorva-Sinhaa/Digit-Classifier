# MNIST Digit Classifier

A simple handwritten digit classifier built using PyTorch.

This project was created to learn PyTorch fundamentals through hands-on practice, including loading data, training a model, evaluating accuracy, and visualizing predictions.

## What it does

- Trains a neural network on the MNIST dataset
- Predicts handwritten digits (0–9)
- Displays sample images with predicted and true labels

---

## Tech Used

- Python
- PyTorch
- torchvision
- matplotlib
